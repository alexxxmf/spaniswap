# Spaniswap

This is a Uniswap V2 clone coded from scrath that I use not only to prove to myself my knowledge around how Uniswap works but also to improve my Solidity Skills.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
